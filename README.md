This is a C# CLI program to solve the puzzles from "Advent of Code". 
I created this project to sharpen my C# skills and am learning more each day!

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety
of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you
like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework,
practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other."

Each puzzle's solution is found in the AoC Library folder (i.e. Day01.cs)
